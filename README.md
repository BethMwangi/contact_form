# contact_form
A custom contact form using Flask and Python3


## Prerequisites
For this program to run efficiently you need this:
* Python 2.7
* Flask_WTF
* Flask
* Flask-Mail
* Git

## Usage
In order to run this program make sure you have python 2.7 installed in your machine or python3 environment activated and clone this repo into the folder you're working from.



```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/BethMwangi/contact_form.git
$  pip install virtual env
$ . venv/bin/activate
$  cd django-feedback/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt


## Note
The email will be sent from the configured account in app.config["MAIL_USERNAME"]

## Conclusion
The task was to create a simple contact form that can be used in a web page. Forms appear in many web applications and the task was to use the required Flask extensions that extend the functionality in Flask apps.
